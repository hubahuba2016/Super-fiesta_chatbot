This is the source code of my first AI chatbot helped by many AIs, chatgpt and grok in particulars, i also have the help of Gemmy AI to cope for the day
the working app can be found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cK8CNf2-JgqEyKBMRFaBrHvMuL09Xm_H?usp=drive_link

you can train the AI by typing "train" and you can successfully exit by typing "exit"

The android port using Java is now available, just download the folder SingleFileJavaAINew, and as you might have guessed, it's not a single file (sorry about that)
Install the dependency and compile the files with the jar files (they are dependency also)
I could run it on termux, you should be able too!

And as for that i'm finishing this project.
Good luck!

Have fun!
